# Latex

Maintain latex documents locally is rather hard. Packages should be installed manually, barely any intellisense, hard for collaboration...
A great cloud alternative is Overleaf. https://www.overleaf.com. Easy file collaboration, version control, a lot of preinstalled packages and great documentation.
