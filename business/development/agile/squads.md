# Your primary home
You and your fellow squad members are on the same long-term mission and spend your days in each other's company. This self-organiz$ing entity possesses all the skills and tools needed to cover the entire workflow, from design to release.

A squad consists of 4 up to 8 people. Its composition is typically based on specific needs and can evolve over time, depending on the experise and capacity that is required. Every squad must be formally approved by higher management. 

There are several types of squads each with their own mission and objectives. Although there is no actual hierarchy in squads (apart from the operational authority), all squad members have a well-defined key role, according to expertise and type of squad. Each of these roles comes with its own specific responsibilities. However, it is up to every member to see to it that the squad is successful, no matter which part they fulfill. Taking ownership is a general responsibilities. 

# Deploy squads
## The mission
Delmiver the best possible customer experience for a wide variety of tasks, ranging from project implementation all the way to post-delivery services. 
## Objectives

* Watch over the intrinsic quality of the software and the solutions delivered (bugs & defects, scalability reliability, uniformity, maintainability, etc.)
* Watch over the look & feel of the UI, consistency and intuitiveness of the UI, responsiveness of the solution, ease of use, efficiency to deal with the task at hand, etc.
* Ensure that everyone in the squad pays attention to the quality and user experience, challenging them at every iteration in that respect, and continuously guiding them to improve this. 
* Ask the right questions at every iteration of the software or the solution to create awareness, to keep the focus and mitigate risks from the very beginning.

	* Did you test this?
  * How did you test this?
  * What are the factual results? 
  * At which scale did you test this?
  * Is this effectively the scale at which this will be deployed?
  * How long did this soak?
  * Did we perform regression testing? 
  * Did we integrate the lessons learned from last week into our regression testing?
  * What went wrong or what can we do better next time around, and how can we make sure? 
  * Can we be confident based on these specific tests, or do we need to look at it differently? 
  * What are the risks for this upgrade, and how could we mitigate those?
  * Is this effectively how the user will be using it?
  * Is this UI consistent with what we delivered earlier?
  * Will the everyday user understand how to use it?
  * Is this an effective solution for what the end user wants to do?
  * Do we understand exactly what the user wants to achieve?
  * How responsive will this UI be in a fully loaded system?
	* We might have done a good job, but how can we even do a better? 
  
* Keep abreast of industry best practices in relation to quality and user interface, internal corporate guidelines related to this domain, general technology evolutions, helpful tools and techniques, etc. and leverage that knowledge to assist the squad (e.g. swarming, smoke testing, unit tests, peer reviews, checklists, design guidelines, common libraries, RANOREX, feature toggle, dark launch, canary testing...)
* Do **not** do all the testing and user experience related to design, but instead create an environment where quality and user experience of the delivered solution/software is owned by the entire squad, as a shared responsibility.
* Exchange experiences with peers (typically via the associated QX guild), and work with peers to maintain an efficient and streamlined operation accross the squads (e.g. develop comon standars, tools, guidelines, training...)
