# Agile Principles 

> *Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change - Stephen Hawking*

### Why are we taking the road to an agile organization
At Massief, we want to make sure we always stay ahead of the needs of our customers and changes in the industry. Technological innovation inspires new management approaches. Such innovation expands our capabilities and broadens our horizon. 

Compared to traditional management approaches, an agile organization offers a number of major benefits, such as an increase in team productivity and employee satisfaction. On the other hand, it improves customer engagement and satisfaction because of our ability to continually and effectively adapt to changing priorities. If members from multiple disciplines behave as collaborative peers and act accordingly, we all build on organizational experience and mutual trust and respect. 

### The Ten Agile Commandments

if ever in doubt about what it means to be Agile, consult these ten commandments.

1. Nurture and satisfy the customer through early, valuable and continuous delivery
2. Welcome change and adapt to new circumstances at all times, and as such harness change for the customer's competitive advantage
3. Support, trust and motivate the people around you to get the job done
4. Value individuals and face-to-face interaction over processes and tools
5. Take ownership and be self-organized
6. Measure progress and success through functional and qualitative deliverables
7. Pay continuous attention to technical excellence, quality and good design. 
8. Adhere to the art of simplicity - tackle what needs to be done urgently and move on to the next task. 
9. Reflect upon oneself and one's squad in order to improve and grow
10. Fall quickly and learn from it

### There is an 'i' in agile

Each and Every Massief expert is a crucial part of our agile operation. That's why taking ownership is so important. Rather than following the clichÃ© expression "there is no "i" in team", we believe that long-term tasks can only be successfully completed if every individual enhances their skills and abilities along the way. We must all aspire to support and behave according to the spirit of the agile values and take up our responsibilities as best as we possibly can. If every Massiever bears this in mind, we are already halfway on the road to success.
